# LCD Shutdown Messages & 5-Second Emergency Response

**Version:** v1.5.4  
**Date:** 19. November 2025  
**Feature:** Persistent LCD shutdown messages + faster emergency response

---

## 🎯 Feature Overview

### Problem
After Jetson powers off, the LCD display stays powered on (from external power). Without context, users don't know:
- **Was the shutdown intentional?** (User pressed button)
- **Was it an emergency?** (Battery critical)
- **Did it shutdown cleanly?** (No corruption)

### Solution
Display **persistent shutdown messages** on LCD that remain visible after power-off:
- ✅ `"User Shutdown"` - GUI shutdown button pressed
- ✅ `"Battery Shutdown"` - Critical battery triggered emergency shutdown

LCD stays powered → Message visible → User knows shutdown reason! 🎉

## 📺 LCD Shutdown Messages

### 1️⃣ User Shutdown (GUI Button Press)

**Trigger:** User presses "Shutdown System" button in web GUI  
**LCD Display Sequence:**
```
Line 1: "User Shutdown"
Line 2: "Please Wait..."
Duration: 1 second (ensures LCD write completes)
Then: System powers off (message stays visible on LCD!)
```

**Implementation:** `apps/drone_web_controller/drone_web_controller.cpp` (line ~1529)
```cpp
} else if (request.find("POST /api/shutdown") != std::string::npos) {
    response = generateAPIResponse("Shutdown initiated");
    send(client_socket, response.c_str(), response.length(), 0);
    
    std::cout << std::endl << "[WEB_CONTROLLER] System shutdown requested via GUI" << std::endl;
    
    // Display final message on LCD (stays visible after power off)
    updateLCD("User Shutdown", "Please Wait...");
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));  // Ensure LCD write completes
    
    system_shutdown_requested_ = true;  // Power off system
    shutdown_requested_ = true;          // Also stop application
    return;
}
```

**User Experience:**
```
User clicks "Shutdown System" button
→ GUI shows: "Shutdown initiated"
→ LCD shows: "User Shutdown" / "Please Wait..."
→ System powers off after ~3-5 seconds
→ LCD STILL shows: "User Shutdown" (powered by external 5V)
→ User knows: "I pressed the button, shutdown was intentional" ✅
```

### 2️⃣ Battery Emergency Shutdown

**Trigger:** Battery voltage < 14.4V for 10 consecutive readings (5 seconds total)  
**LCD Display Sequence:**
```
While counting (0-9):
  Line 1: "CRITICAL BATT"
  Line 2: "1/10" ... "9/10"

At 10/10 (if recording):
  Line 1: "CRITICAL BATT"
  Line 2: "Stopping Rec..."
  Duration: 500ms (while stopRecording() runs)

Final message:
  Line 1: "Battery Shutdown"
  Line 2: "Critical!" (if V > 14.0V) OR "Empty!" (if V < 14.0V)
  Duration: 2 seconds (ensures LCD write completes + user can read)
  
Then: System powers off (message stays visible on LCD!)
```

**Implementation:** `apps/drone_web_controller/drone_web_controller.cpp` (line ~1190-1205)
```cpp
if (critical_battery_counter_ >= 10) {
    std::cerr << "[WEB_CONTROLLER] CRITICAL THRESHOLD REACHED!" << std::endl;
    
    updateLCD("CRITICAL BATT", "Stopping Rec...");
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(500));

    // Stop recording if active
    if (recording_active_) {
        stopRecording();
    }

    // Display final message on LCD (stays visible after power off)
    updateLCD("Battery Shutdown", battery.voltage < 14.0f ? "Empty!" : "Critical!");
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(2));  // Ensure LCD write completes
    
    system_shutdown_requested_ = true;
    shutdown_requested_ = true;
    break;  // Exit monitor loop immediately
}
```

**User Experience:**
```
Battery drops below 14.4V
→ Console spam: "CRITICAL BATTERY VOLTAGE detected (count=1/10)" ... (count=10/10)
→ LCD shows: "CRITICAL BATT" / "1/10" → "9/10" (5 seconds of warnings)
→ If recording: LCD shows "CRITICAL BATT" / "Stopping Rec..." (0.5s)
→ LCD shows: "Battery Shutdown" / "Critical!" (2 seconds)
→ System powers off
→ LCD STILL shows: "Battery Shutdown" / "Critical!"
→ User knows: "Battery was empty, not my fault" ✅
```

## ⚡ 5-Second Emergency Response

### Previous Behavior (v1.5.3 and earlier)
```
Battery check: Every 1 second
Critical readings required: 10 consecutive
Total time until shutdown: 10 seconds ❌ Too slow!
```

### New Behavior (v1.5.4)
```
Battery check: Every 500ms (0.5 seconds)
Critical readings required: 10 consecutive
Total time until shutdown: 5 seconds ✅ Fast response!
```

**Implementation:** `apps/drone_web_controller/drone_web_controller.cpp` (line ~1270)
```cpp
// Bottom of systemMonitorLoop():
std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(500));  
// Check battery every 500ms (5s until shutdown with 10 confirmations)
```

**Why 10 confirmations still needed?**
- Prevents false shutdowns from voltage spikes/noise
- Battery voltage can fluctuate ±0.1V during recording
- 10 × 500ms = 5 seconds is good balance between safety and speed

## 🔍 Shutdown Reason Detection

After powering on the Jetson, user can check LCD:

| LCD Display | Meaning | Cause |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| `User Shutdown` | Intentional | User pressed GUI button |
| `Battery Shutdown` / `Critical!` | Emergency | Battery voltage dropped below 14.4V |
| `Battery Shutdown` / `Empty!` | Emergency | Battery completely drained (<14.0V) |
| `Web Controller` / `10.42.0.1:8080` | Normal | System is running (no shutdown yet) |
| Blank LCD | Power loss | LCD lost power OR system crashed (rare) |

**Use Cases:**
1. **Field Test Review:** "Did the drone land because I told it to, or battery died?"
   - Check LCD → `User Shutdown` = Intentional ✅
   - Check LCD → `Battery Shutdown` = Battery emergency ⚠️

2. **Debugging Unexpected Shutdowns:** "System powered off during flight - why?"
   - LCD shows `Battery Shutdown` → Battery problem (check logs for voltage)
   - LCD blank → Power supply issue or crash

3. **Battery Capacity Testing:** "How long can I record before emergency shutdown?"
   - Start recording, wait for `Battery Shutdown` message
   - Check recording logs for total duration

## 📊 Timing Breakdown

### User Shutdown (GUI Button)
```
t=0s:    User clicks "Shutdown System" button
         GUI response: "Shutdown initiated"
         LCD update: "User Shutdown" / "Please Wait..."
t=+1s:   LCD write confirmed complete
         Set shutdown flags
t=+2s:   handleShutdown() called (stops recording if active)
t=+3s:   Recording stop complete (if was recording)
t=+4s:   WiFi AP teardown
t=+5s:   main() executes: sudo shutdown -h now
t=+10s:  Jetson powered off
         LCD STILL shows: "User Shutdown" ✅
```

### Battery Emergency Shutdown
```
t=0s:    Battery drops below 14.4V
t=+0.5s: Counter = 1/10, LCD: "CRITICAL BATT" / "1/10"
t=+1.0s: Counter = 2/10, LCD: "CRITICAL BATT" / "2/10"
...
t=+4.5s: Counter = 9/10, LCD: "CRITICAL BATT" / "9/10"
t=+5.0s: Counter = 10/10 → SHUTDOWN TRIGGERED
         LCD: "CRITICAL BATT" / "Stopping Rec..."
t=+5.5s: Recording stopped (if was active)
         LCD: "Battery Shutdown" / "Critical!"
t=+7.5s: LCD write confirmed (2 second display + safety)
         Set shutdown flags
         Break out of monitor loop
t=+8s:   handleShutdown() called
t=+9s:   WiFi AP teardown
t=+10s:  main() executes: sudo shutdown -h now
t=+15s:  Jetson powered off
         LCD STILL shows: "Battery Shutdown" / "Critical!" ✅
```

**Total emergency response time:** 5 seconds from first critical reading to shutdown initiation

## 🧪 Testing Procedures

### Test 1: User Shutdown Message
```bash
# 1. Start system
sudo systemctl restart drone-recorder

# 2. Open GUI: http://192.168.4.1:8080

# 3. Click "Shutdown System" button

# 4. Observe LCD:
# Expected: "User Shutdown" / "Please Wait..."

# 5. Wait for system to power off (~5 seconds)

# 6. Check LCD (should still be powered by external 5V)
# Expected: "User Shutdown" / "Please Wait..." STILL VISIBLE ✅

# 7. Power on Jetson again
# Expected: LCD briefly shows boot messages, then "Web Controller"
```

### Test 2: Battery Emergency Shutdown (5-Second Response)
```bash
# 1. Start system with recording active
# GUI: Start Recording

# 2. Lower power supply voltage below 14.4V

# 3. Observe console (via journalctl or direct terminal):
# Expected:
# "⚠️⚠️⚠️ CRITICAL BATTERY VOLTAGE detected (count=1/10)"
# ... (every 500ms)
# "⚠️⚠️⚠️ CRITICAL BATTERY VOLTAGE detected (count=10/10)"
# "CRITICAL THRESHOLD REACHED!"
# "Stopping active recording before shutdown..."
# "Emergency shutdown flags set"

# 4. Observe LCD during countdown:
# Expected: "CRITICAL BATT" / "1/10" → "2/10" → ... → "9/10"
# Then: "CRITICAL BATT" / "Stopping Rec..."
# Then: "Battery Shutdown" / "Critical!"

# 5. Measure time from first warning to shutdown initiation
# Expected: ~5 seconds (10 × 500ms)

# 6. Check LCD after power off
# Expected: "Battery Shutdown" / "Critical!" STILL VISIBLE ✅

# 7. Verify recording integrity
cd /media/angelo/DRONE_DATA/flight_*/
ls -lh video.svo2
# Should exist and be valid (no corruption)
```

### Test 3: Counter Reset (Battery Recovery)
```bash
# 1. System running, voltage drops to 14.3V (critical)

# 2. Observe console:
# "CRITICAL BATTERY VOLTAGE detected (count=1/10)"
# "CRITICAL BATTERY VOLTAGE detected (count=2/10)"
# ... (counter incrementing)

# 3. At count=5/10, raise voltage back to 15.0V (above 14.4V)

# 4. Observe console:
# Expected: "✓ Battery recovered to 15.0V - reset critical counter (was: 5)"

# 5. Verify counter reset
# Lower voltage again → counter starts at 1/10 (not 6/10) ✅
```

## 💡 Best Practices

### DO:
- ✅ Check LCD after unexpected shutdowns (shows reason)
- ✅ Use "User Shutdown" for intentional power-offs
- ✅ Monitor console logs for critical battery warnings
- ✅ Test battery shutdown behavior before missions

### DON'T:
- ❌ Ignore LCD messages (they indicate shutdown cause!)
- ❌ Power off Jetson manually during recording (use GUI button)
- ❌ Assume blank LCD = intentional shutdown (might be power loss)
- ❌ Remove external LCD power (loses shutdown diagnostics)

## 🎓 Technical Notes

### Why 2-second LCD display time for battery shutdown?
```
updateLCD("Battery Shutdown", "Critical!");
std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(2));
```

**Reasons:**
1. **LCD I2C write time:** ~80-100ms (must complete before power-off)
2. **User readability:** User needs time to see the message before power-off
3. **Safety margin:** Ensures message is fully displayed, not cut off mid-write
4. **Recording stop time:** If recording was active, ensures stop is complete

**Total shutdown sequence:** 2s LCD + 3s cleanup = ~5 seconds after critical threshold

### Why check battery every 500ms instead of faster?
- **I2C bandwidth:** Battery monitor already samples at 1Hz (1000ms)
- **No benefit to faster checks:** We read cached values from BatteryMonitor thread
- **500ms = good balance:** Fast enough for emergencies, not CPU-intensive
- **10 confirmations:** Still provides 5-second validation period
